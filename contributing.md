* The project must be **made in tanzania** as the name implies :grin:.

* The project should have at least 10 stars. This is to serve as a way to determine that people actually have a use for the project and it does what it says it does. [ Stars likely to go up as time goes on :smiley: ].

* The project should not be a list of some sort.

* Ensure to provide a social media url of the creator of the project outside GitHub.

* Try to add the project to it's appropriate alphabetical location.

* You might want to include the **made in Tanzania** ([![Made in Tanzania](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20in-tanzania-008751.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Tanzania-Developers-Community/made-in-tanzania)) badge to your project.
